# Chains in LangChain

This repository demonstrates how to implement and use **different types of chains** in LangChain. Chaining lets you connect components together â€” prompts, parsers, and models â€” to create more sophisticated workflows. 
This project covers **simple chains**, **sequential chains**, **parallel chains**, and **conditional chains**. These techniques help you build flexible and reusable components for your applications.


## ðŸ“„ File Descriptions

- `simple_chain.py`  Creates a **simple chain**.

- `sequential_chain.py`  Demonstrates **SequentialChain**.

- `parallel_chain.py`  Shows how to execute chains in **parallel**.

- `conditional_chain.py`  Demonstrates **Conditional Chain**.
